# Unit Converter

A website app to convert a given number between metric and imperial units of length, volume, and mass.

## Key Points

This project is to demonstrate and highlight use of HTML and CSS, but most importantly JavaScript. Convertions are displayed using **template literals** and the unit names will be displayed as either singular or plural based on it's value using **ternary operators**. These can be found in the function `convertion()` from line 34 of `index.js`.
